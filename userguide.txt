Userguide for News Webservice:

Product Description:
There are two projects developed to resolve problem statement:

1) NewsEngineWebservices : This is main project which hosts webservices.
2) WebserviceConsumer    : This is just a consumer main classes which is only for sake of consuming Web Service.

Webservice Specifications:
The two major webservice classes and their description is as below:

1) NewsEngineServiceProvider.java :
   This webservice accepts the inputs from user and creates news from it. For sake of simplicity, news in stored in "D:/news" directory as a xml file. The name of file is computed as <timestamp>_<priority>_<content_type>_news.xml
   
   
   a) public String createNews : Receives inputs in arguments and writes it to flat file system.
   
   
2) NewsGetter.java :
   This webservice returns various news as requested by reading xml files of news. It has different methods to get Breaking news, Sports/Finance/General news and also news as per timestamp.
   
   a) public String  getNews(@PathParam("datetime") String datetime) : return news as per datetime.
   b) public String  getNews() : Returns 100 Breaking news (the priority one news)
   c) public String  getSportsNews() : Returns sports news.
   d) public String  getFinanceNews() : Returns finance news.
   e) public String  getGeneralNews() : Returns general news.
   

Logic used in webservices:
While adding/posting news, a file is created as <timestamp>_<priority>_<content_type>_news.xml. 
While reading,various contents of  file name is used to identify news.

Consumers of Webservices:
All below consumers just consumes the webservices and prints the responses.

	a)BreakingNews.java
	b)FinanceNews.java
	c)GeneralNews.java
	d)PostNews.java
	e)SportsNews.java

Building Webservices:

NewsEngineWebservices : run pom.xml of NewsEngineWebservices to build project.

WebserviceConsumer: Just main methods. No need to build.
	
Assumptions and Limitations:
1) Database is not used for keeping project simple.
2) Messaging system is not used, rather on demand model of consumer is used to read files as and when needed.
